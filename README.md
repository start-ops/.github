At StartOps, we love small business. We know how hard it can be to find Infrastructure Engineers who can 

- accelerate the build, test, and release process
- provide visibility into operations and system performance
- build reliable systems

so at StartOps, we offer an opinionated perspective on what tools and techniques to invest in based on your current needs and priorities. 

Let's face it. As a startup, you've only got so much time and resources. Your goal is to find product / market fit, and validate a thesis. Your tools should help you do that. Anything more is only going to slow you down.
